## Frappe CRM

Frappe CRM is a simple, affordable, open-source CRM tool designed for modern sales teams with unlimited users. Frappe CRM is crafted for providing a great user experience, packed with features for core CRM activities helping you build strong customer relationships while keeping things clean and organised.

-   **All-in-One Lead/Deal Page:** Consolidate all essential actions and details—like activities, comments, notes, tasks, and more—into a single page for a seamless workflow experience.
-   **Kanban View:** Manage leads and deals visually with a drag-and-drop Kanban board, offering clarity and efficiency in tracking progress across stages.
-   **Custom Views:** Design personalized views to organize and display leads and deals using custom filters, sorting, and columns, ensuring quick access to the most relevant information.
